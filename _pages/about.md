I am a senior double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Washington. I am currently working with Prof. [Richard Ladner](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/ladner) on accessibility reseach. I also assist with "Low Resource Multimodal Machine Learning for wildlife monitoring" project led by [Emmanuel Azuh Mensah](https://emazuh.github.io/) of [ICTD Lab](https://ictd.cs.washington.edu/). I hope to continue exploring accessibility technology in various fields, and software engineering in accessibility.
