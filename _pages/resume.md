Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics, University of Washington, December 2024 (expected)

Work Experience
======
* Data Mining Intern, China Construction Bank Corporation
  * Optimized machine learning models for predicting Indian Car Loans Overdue.
  * Analyzed data and did feature engineering to fit the models (size: ~233k) in Python.
  * Optimized and improved the accuracy of logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and XGBoost models, and reached an accuracy of 78% for the XGBoost model. 

Project Experience
======
* Open Space Navigation - Accessibility Technology Research
  * Developing an Android application to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating open spaces. 
  * Implemented functions including recording paths by coordinates, and navigating the user using the Douglas−Peucker algorithm. Integrated Google Maps and Google Play APIs into the app to enable accurate GPS recognition.
  * Improved user experience with Accessibility features, including providing different types of navigation output (text, speech, vibration), and sorting paths dynamically according to user’s current location.
  * Enhanced the app’s functionality by testing with Plane-Sweep Algorithm on GPS accuracy in different Android devices.

* Low Resource Environmental Monitoring With Machine Learning, UW ICTD Lab
  * Investigated how to utilize roughly time-aligned multimodal environmental monitoring data (visual, audio, audio-visual, etc.) for fine-grained species classification, and to learn informative metrics for ecological analysis.
  * Experimented with audioset augmentation by blending with other background noises, and co-training on the joint 
classification and object localization objectives to compute attention maps between audio and visual representations.

* ALRITE Customization - Android Application (Group)
  * Modified the Ugandan healthcare Android application ALRITE to parse and display workflows specified in JSON.
  * Implemented a user-friendly workflow editor for non-technical users to create and modify workflows.
  * Developed a Django backend database to store JSON workflow files and dynamically build patient information 
based on collected data.

* UW Center for Education Data & Research
  * Analyzed nationwide school district job shortage dynamics and teacher employment trends based on job postings throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Python. 
  * Web-scraped XPATH and extracted text from the school district and job posting websites. Collected and systemized ~70k school-related job posting information in 4 states.
