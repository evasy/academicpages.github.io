Hi I'm Yitong! I am currently pursuing BS degree in Computer Science and Statistics at UW, Seattle, WA.

I have stayed at:
  * Shenyang, China♨️ 
  * Hershey, PA🍫
  * Arcadia, CA☀️
  * Seattle, WA🏔️

In my freetime, I enjoy walking, hiking, traveling, board-gaming, and cooking. I also run a social account on music/art/fashion concepts with 4k+ followers. I'll always make food for my friends! If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach out by email!

I have a 6-year old cat 团团(TuanTuan)!
