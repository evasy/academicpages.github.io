Hi I'm Yitong! I am currently pursuing BS degree in Computer Science and Statistics at UW, Seattle, WA.

Before college, I lived in many different places: I grew up in Shenyang, China, lived in Hershey, PA when I was in elementary school for 1.5 years, and 2 years in Arcadia, CA when I was in high school. My experiences in different places made me a positive, adaptive and outgoing person. ‚òÄÔ∏è

In my freetime, I love to talk to people üëÄ, I enjoy walking, hiking, traveling. I also run a social account on music/art/fashion concepts with 4k+ followers. I am still exploring gaming, which I had a goal of completing Resident Evil 8 this quarter (we'll see about that lol). If you're a fan of TVXQ then we can talk for days!

I have a 6-year old cat called Âõ¢Âõ¢(TuanTuan), I adopted him when he was born.
